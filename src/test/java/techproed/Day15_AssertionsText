What is the difference between assertion and verification?
* Assertion means hard assertion.
* Verification means soft assertion.
* Verification is similar to if else statement.
* If hard assertion fails, rest of the test case stops.

What is the difference between soft assert and hard assert?
* Hard assertion stops execution, after assertion failure.
* Soft assert continues to execute even after failure
* We need to create a soft assert object to do soft assertion
* assertAll() need to be used in soft assert to make the actual result

Which assertion do you prefer? Why?
* I used both.
* Both assertion are useful.
* But I used hard assertion the most, because I need to fix the issue the moment it shows up.
* It usually doesâ€™t make sense to wait for other tests if there is a failure.
* If there are  lots of test cases , I prefer to use hard assert to find the wrong test case quickly to fix it.
* If I use soft assertion, It will run all the tests every time even there are wrong cases in them.
* I usually use soft assertion when I write new test cases to see if all good or some fails.
